edge/rules_engine.py — Deterministic Agronomic Rules Engine (Step 27).

Evaluates verified disease classifications, spatial consensus, and environmental inputs
to emit auditable, deterministic action recommendations for farmers.

Contract Alignment:
  - ans_for_vitthal.md §7 F1, F4, F5:
    * The Jetson emits actions[] deterministically with stable template_id and params.
    * generated_by is MANDATORY and is ALWAYS "template" (never "llm", "placeholder", or "rules_engine").
    * English strings and rationales are included for direct rendering in English.
    * The mobile app uses template_id + params to render Hindi/regional languages offline.
  - Agronomic Provenance & Governance:
    * Master Template Provenance (21 templates):
      - 3 VERIFIED (operational consensus gating & irrigation calculation traced to repo code/specs)
      - 11 WEB_VERIFIED (primary legal CIB&RC / PPQS registered label claims backed by files in docs/sources/)
      - 5 RECALLED_UNVERIFIED (unverified against physical publications; pending blocking KVK review)
      - 2 UNSOURCED (consultation and unregistered disease procedural fallbacks)
    * Each web-verified template records its primary source URL, exact document reference, and offline_source_file.
  - Python 3.6 Compatibility:
    * No walrus operator (:=), no f-string debugging (=), no @dataclass, no union type hints (|).
