# SIH 2026 (PS 26180): Remaining Scope Accounting & Build Plan

**Document ID:** `docs/REMAINING_SCOPE_PLAN.md`  
**Date:** 16 September 2026  
**Final Submission Deadline:** 30 September 2026 (**14 days remaining**)  
**Current System State:** Model A FP16 TensorRT pipeline, SQLite storage (`edge/storage.py`), and offline HTTP Gateway (`gateway/server.py`) complete and verified with 239 passing regression tests. Physical Jetson Nano execution is under active verification via `docs/NANO_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`.

---

## 1. Executive Summary: The 14-Day Reality Check

With the submission deadline extended to **30 September 2026**, there is sufficient time to build the remaining high-value features properly rather than cutting scope. However, physical hardware constraints remain immutable: **sensors that have not arrived cannot produce physical photons or voltages by 30 September**.

In hackathon judging, the single fastest way to lose credibility is to claim hardware-level sensing (thermal canopy temperature, multi-spectral NIR NDVI, or physical capacitance soil probing) while presenting numbers generated from software hacks or simulated constants disguised as real measurements. Conversely, **the single highest-scoring strategy is engineering honesty**: demonstrating a production-grade edge pipeline that produces real measurements where physical sensors exist, and emits explicit, auditable `null-with-reason` degraded payloads where sensors are absent.

## 2. Detailed Accounting of Remaining Scope Items

### Item 1: Model B (Sticky Trap Pest CNN)
- **What it is:** A lightweight CNN (~150k parameters, 4 conv blocks) running on the gateway (laptop/Nano) to classify 64×64 cropped insect blobs extracted by `core/trap_segmentation.py` into specific pest species (whitefly, aphid, leafhopper, planthopper) vs. `not_pest` (dust, debris, paper fiber, beneficials).
- **What currently exists in code:**
  - [`core/trap_segmentation.py`](file:///Users/mohdahsan/Downloads/SIH/sih-smart-farming/core/trap_segmentation.py): **Fully built and tested.** Implements ArUco fiducial homography, perspective correction, adaptive thresholding, watershed segmentation, 4-corner marker exclusion, and ICAR-compliant relative trend tracking.
  - Directory [`firmware/esp32cam_trap/`](file:///Users/mohdahsan/Downloads/SIH/sih-smart-farming/firmware/esp32cam_trap): Empty directory.
  - `configs/trap_config.py`, `train/train_model_b.py`, `gateway/trap_receiver.py`, `gateway/trap_count.py`: **Do not exist.**
- **What is missing:**
  1. `configs/trap_config.py`: Taxonomy mapping, minimum/maximum blob dimensions, and target pest classes.
  2. `train/train_model_b.py`: Training pipeline for `TrapPestCNN`.
  3. `gateway/trap_receiver.py`: Endpoint accepting POSTed JPEGs from the field camera.
  4. `gateway/trap_count.py`: Orchestrator calling segmentation $\rightarrow$ Model B classification $\rightarrow$ SQLite logging.
- **What blocks it:** **Data and Hardware.** The ESP32-CAM physical trap station has not been deployed in an active field. Real physical sticky trap images from Indian fields do not exist in the repository.
- **Can public datasets substitute?**
  - **Yes, for training and bench validation.** Open-access yellow sticky card datasets exist:
    * *Yellow Sticky Traps Dataset* (Mendeley / Sabbatini et al.): 1,000+ high-resolution sticky card images with whiteflies, thrips, and aphids.
    * *IP102 Benchmark*: Insect pest crops that can be synthetically composited onto yellow glue background tiles with random rotation and blur.
  - **Limitation:** Models trained on clean greenhouse sticky cards fail when exposed to outdoor Indian dust storms, morning dew, and insect degradation.
- **Estimated effort:** 2.5–3 days.
- **30 Sept Demonstration vs. Honest Fallback:**
  - **Viable Demo:** Train `TrapPestCNN` on public sticky-trap data + synthetic composites. Feed real public sticky-trap validation images through `core/trap_segmentation.py` $\rightarrow$ Model B $\rightarrow$ daily count aggregation.
  - **Honest Disclosure to Judges:** *"Model B was trained on public greenhouse sticky-trap benchmarks and synthetic field composites. Because the physical ESP32-CAM field trap node was bench-tested without long-term outdoor exposure, Model B's weights are presented as a pre-trained baseline requiring on-farm fine-tuning for glue weathering and local insect morphs."*

---

### Item 2: Step 27 — `edge/rules_engine.py` (Agronomic Rules Engine)
- **What it is:** The deterministic agronomic decision engine that transforms raw Model A classification verdicts, spatial cell consensus, and environmental inputs into actionable, explainable farmer advisories. It replaces the current provisional placeholder in `actions[]` (`ACT_RESCAN_AMBIGUOUS` / `ACT_INSPECT_CONFIRM`).
- **What currently exists in code:**
  - [`core/aggregate.py`](file:///Users/mohdahsan/Downloads/SIH/sih-smart-farming/core/aggregate.py): Outputs frame and cell consensus states (`DISEASE`, `HEALTHY`, `UNCERTAIN`, `NO_DATA`).
  - [`edge/storage.py`](file:///Users/mohdahsan/Downloads/SIH/sih-smart-farming/edge/storage.py): Contains `create_advisory()`, which currently emits a placeholder action with `"generated_by": "placeholder"`.
  - [`configs/classes.py`](file:///Users/mohdahsan/Downloads/SIH/sih-smart-farming/configs/classes.py): Full 31-class taxonomy.
  - `edge/rules_engine.py`: **Does not exist.**
- **What is missing:**
  - `edge/rules_engine.py` implementing:
    1. **Disease Action Rules:** Specific, research-backed management interventions sourced directly from ICAR / TNAU / PAU Package of Practices (e.g., `rice__bacterial_leaf_blight` $\rightarrow$ spray Streptocycline 100g + Copper Oxychloride 500g in 200L water per acre; drain field; halt top-dressing nitrogen).
    2. **Consensus Degradation Rules:** When `crop_health.state == "UNCERTAIN"` or `MULTIPLE_CROPS_DETECTED`, generate structured scouting and re-scan instructions rather than generic errors.
    3. **Healthy Maintenance Rules:** When `crop_health.state == "HEALTHY"`, emit crop-specific preventive guidance and scouting intervals.
    4. **Environmental Risk Rules:** Graceful evaluation of temperature, humidity, and water inputs when available, with explicit skip reasons when sensors are unattached.
    5. **Provable Provenance:** Every action dictionary must include `rule_id`, `citation` (e.g. `ICAR-IIRR Technical Bulletin No. 42`), and `rationale`.
- **Can it be built and wired now with existing outputs?**
  - **YES, IMMEDIATELY.** It has **ZERO hardware dependencies** for disease, crop, and ambiguity actions.
  - The pipeline already outputs clean, verified crop disease classifications.
  - Sensor-dependent rules (heat stress, drought, CWSI) can be evaluated conditionally: if sensor readings are present in SQLite, evaluate them; if absent, record `status: "SKIPPED_INPUT_ABSENT"`.
- **Estimated effort:** 1.5 days.
- **30 Sept Demonstration:** **100% LIVE DEMO.** This directly fulfills Problem Statement Requirement 6 ("Actionable farmer advisory with explanations").

---

### Item 3: The Unwired Deterministic Modules
Four modules were built, audited, and tested, but currently sit uncalled by `edge/pipeline.py`.

#### 3.1 `core/indices.py` (RGB Visible Vegetation Indices)
- **What exists:** Complete implementation of Excess Green (`ExG`), `VARI`, `TGI`, `NGRDI`, `DGCI`, and absolute vegetation masking.
- **Wiring requirements:** Trivial. Can be called directly in Thread 2 (`GateTileThread`) or Thread 4 (`DecisionAggregateStoreThread`) on the RGB camera frames.
- **What it produces TODAY:** **100% REAL MEASUREMENTS.** Standard RGB camera video/stills are already streaming through the pipeline. It calculates real canopy green fraction and RGB vegetation indices per frame and per cell.
- **30 Sept Strategy:** **WIRE IMMEDIATELY.** Displays real crop vigour and canopy coverage alongside disease classification.

#### 3.2 `core/thermal.py` (Canopy Temperature & CWSI)
- **What exists:** Bimodal Otsu canopy thermal segmentation, MLX90614 cross-check validation, and Idso CWSI formulas.
- **Wiring requirements:** Requires thermal sensor array data (`MLX90640` 32×24 grid) + air temperature ($T_a$) + vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
- **What it produces TODAY:** **NULL-WITH-REASON.** Without physical thermal array hardware connected via I2C to the Nano, canopy temperature cannot be measured.
- **30 Sept Strategy:** **HONEST DISCLOSURE.** Wire `core/thermal.py` into the advisory schema so that in the absence of hardware it emits:
  ```json
  "thermal_cwsi": {
    "status": "UNATTACHED",
    "cwsi": null,
    "canopy_temp_c": null,
    "reason": "THERMAL_ARRAY_HARDWARE_UNATTACHED"
  }
  ```
  Provide a `--simulate-sensors` flag for offline verification so judges can see the math run, but label live runs honestly.

#### 3.3 `core/ndvi.py` (Dual-Bandpass NIR/Red NDVI)
- **What exists:** MidOpt DB660/850 dual-bandpass channel mapping (Blue=NIR, Red=Visible Red), cross-talk architecture, empirical line calibration scaffolding.
- **Wiring requirements:** Requires a second CSI camera (`IMX219-77IR` NoIR) with physical dual-bandpass optical filter, plus a bench-measured silicon cross-talk matrix $K^{-1}$.
- **What it produces TODAY:** **NULL-WITH-REASON.** `core/ndvi.py` explicitly raises `NotImplementedError` if the cross-talk matrix is missing, because calculating "NDVI" from raw RGB or uncalibrated NoIR without cross-talk correction is scientifically invalid.
- **30 Sept Strategy:** **HONEST DISCLOSURE.** Emphasize visible RGB indices (`VARI`, `ExG` from `core/indices.py`) as the operational vigour metric for the single RGB camera pod. Disclose dual-camera NoIR NDVI as a planned multi-spectral hardware upgrade.

#### 3.4 `edge/irrigation_model.py` (FAO-56 Crop Water Balance)
- **What exists:** FAO-56 Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration ($ET_0$), Hargreaves-Samani temperature equation, and Table 12 crop coefficients ($K_c$) for rice, sugarcane, and wheat.
- **Wiring requirements:** Pure algorithmic math. Requires daily weather inputs ($T_{max}, T_{min}, RH$, wind, solar radiation) and planting dates.
- **What it produces TODAY:** Real reference evapotranspiration ($ET_0$) and crop water demand ($ET_c$) if weather data is supplied via offline table or local weather API. Soil moisture deficit, however, requires physical soil probes and must emit `soil_deficit: null`.
- **30 Sept Strategy:** **DEMO SCRIPT.** Wire as an advisory calculator in `edge/rules_engine.py`: given local weather inputs, compute daily crop water demand in mm/day and prescribe manual irrigation volume to the farmer (autonomous actuation was already formally dropped).

---

### Item 4: Growth Staging (Canopy Cover + Days After Sowing)
- **What it is:** Deterministic agronomic lookup mapping canopy cover percentage (derived from RGB camera frames) + farmer-entered planting date into phenological growth stages (e.g. Rice: Vegetative/Tillering $\rightarrow$ Panicle Initiation $\rightarrow$ Flowering $\rightarrow$ Ripening).
- **What currently exists:**
  - `core/indices.py` computes exact canopy vegetation fraction.
  - Dedicated module `core/growth_stage.py`: **Does not exist.**
- **What is missing:** A clean lookup module `core/growth_stage.py` containing validated phenological growth tables for Rice, Sugarcane, and Wheat based on FAO/ICAR crop calendars.
- **What blocks it:** **NOTHING.** Software and agronomic tables only.
- **Estimated effort:** 0.5–1 day.
- **30 Sept Demonstration:** **100% LIVE DEMO.** Combines real computer vision (canopy cover fraction) with farmer metadata.

---

### Item 5: Mast Node ESP32 Firmware
- **What it is:** C++/Arduino firmware for an unattended ESP32 field station:
  - Periodically samples SHT40 ambient temp/RH (early draft referenced SHT31; SHT40 confirmed in `docs/HARDWARE_WIRING_GUIDE.md`), capacitive soil moisture, and battery voltage.
  - Broadcasts SoftAP `SIH-NODE-01` (192.168.9.1).
  - Captures sticky trap images via ESP32-CAM.
  - Serves telemetry history over local HTTP GET endpoints when the farmer walks nearby with the handheld pod.
- **What currently exists:**
  - Mock drivers in `edge/adc.py` and `edge/thermal_point.py`.
  - Firmware directory: Empty.
- **What is missing:** Complete Arduino/ESP-IDF firmware sketch.
- **What blocks it:** **HARDWARE DEPENDENT.** Physical ESP32, ESP32-CAM, sensors, and power management circuit.
- **Estimated effort:** 2–3 days.
- **30 Sept Strategy:**
  - Write and bench-test the firmware sketch on desktop ESP32 hardware.
  - If field mast deployment is impossible by 30 Sept, demonstrate the pod's offline synchronization seam (already built into `gateway/server.py` via `set_sync_state()`) using benchtop hardware or simulated packet replay.
  - Disclose honestly to judges: *"Mast station firmware is complete and bench-tested; physical field enclosure is pending weatherproofing and agricultural mount fabrication."*

| **Step 33** | Mobile App / Dashboard | Backend gateway complete (`gateway/server.py`). | **APP TEAM INTEGRATION.** Mobile app is built by app team against `ans_for_vitthal.md`. Provide a lightweight web fallback if app is delayed. |
| **Step 35** | End-to-End Integration Suite (`tests/test_integration.py`) | `test_pipeline.py` & `test_gateway.py` exist. | **BUILD.** Comprehensive test asserting end-to-end flow from video to advisory JSON. |

## 3. Recommended Build Order & Trade-off Analysis

### The Strategic Rationale: Demo-First, No Hardware Illusions

We recommend dividing the remaining 14 days into **four distinct phases**, prioritized strictly by:
1. **Unblocked Software First:** Build features that run on real camera data and require zero pending hardware.
2. **Close the Problem Statement Loop:** Deliver the farmer advisory and explainability features that judges evaluate.
3. **Benchtop & Benchmark Models Second:** Build Model B against published datasets.
4. **Hardware Facades & Fallbacks Last:** Provide clean simulated fallbacks for unattached physical sensors.

### Detailed Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Close the Core Agronomic Loop (16–19 September)
*Goal: Every video scan generates a real, scientifically grounded, multilingual farmer advisory.*
1. **Build `configs/crop_disease_rules.py` & `edge/rules_engine.py` (Step 27):**
   - Source exact ICAR-IIRR (rice) and ICAR-SBI (sugarcane) disease treatment packages.
   - Replace the provisional placeholder in `edge/storage.py` with real, explainable actions.

   - Compute real canopy cover percentage and visible crop vigour (ExG, VARI) from the camera frames.
   - Map canopy cover + planting date to phenological growth stage.
3. **Build `edge/agronomy.py` (Steps 25–26):**
   - Implement CIELAB $b^*$ extraction on leaf pixels for LCC nitrogen assessment.
4. **Build `edge/advisory.py` (Step 28):**
   - Implement offline multilingual template rendering (Hindi + English) with actionable, unambiguous instructions for farmers.

#### Phase 2: Trap Pest Pipeline & Model B (20–23 September)
*Goal: Demonstrate automated pest counting and trend alerting on yellow sticky card imagery.*
1. **Build `configs/trap_config.py` & `configs/etl_thresholds.py`:**

   - Unified interface querying sensors (ADS1115 soil moisture, MLX90640 thermal array, SHT40 air temp/RH [early draft referenced SHT31], GPS).
   - Enforce explicit `null-with-reason` flags (`THERMAL_UNATTACHED`, `SOIL_PROBE_UNATTACHED`, `GPS_UNATTACHED`) when hardware is missing.
   - Include a `--simulate` flag strictly for bench testing and dry runs.
2. **Develop Mast Station Firmware (`firmware/esp32_mast/`):**
   - Arduino/ESP-IDF sketch logging ambient sensors and broadcasting SoftAP `SIH-NODE-01`.
   - Benchtop validation on available ESP32 hardware.

#### Phase 4: System Integration, App Sync & Rehearsal (27–29 September)
*Goal: Bulletproof demonstration with zero crashes, predictable timings, and full documentation.*
1. **Build `tests/test_integration.py` (Step 35):**
   - Exercise the entire chain: video stream $\rightarrow$ FrameGate $\rightarrow$ Tiler $\rightarrow$ Model A $\rightarrow$ Cell Aggregation $\rightarrow$ Rules Engine $\rightarrow$ SQLite Storage $\rightarrow$ HTTP Gateway $\rightarrow$ Phone Sync.
2. **Live Integration with Mobile App Team:**
   - Verify phone client fetches manifest, downloads advisories, and displays Hindi advisory cards.
3. **Create Demonstration Evidence Pack (Step 36):**
   - Record side-by-side video: RGB field video, tiler bounding boxes, classification confidence, and final mobile phone advisory.
   - Draft presentation slides with honest disclosure tables.

## 5. Decision Points for User Approval

Before any code is written, confirm or adjust the following three architectural decisions:

1. **Model B Scope:** Do you approve training `TrapPestCNN` on public sticky-trap benchmarks + synthetic composites, or should we restrict Model B to pure watershed blob density tracking (which has zero synthetic domain-shift risk)?
2. **Phase 1 Priority:** Do you approve building `edge/rules_engine.py` (Step 27) and `core/growth_stage.py` first, replacing the advisory placeholder and wiring visible RGB indices into the live pipeline?
3. **Sensor Policy:** Do you confirm that all hardware-dependent modules (`thermal.py`, `ndvi.py`, `adc.py`) must strictly emit `null-with-reason` in live execution, with `--simulate` restricted strictly to offline test flags?
